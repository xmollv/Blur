This is a dead simple app to blur images. I got sick trying to find an app that did this on the App Store and that it wasn't full of crappy ads or it wasn't updated since iOS 6.

I'm a firm believer that nobody should have a regular photo as the homescreen wallpaper, that's why this app exists. I usually have a regular image for the `Lock Screen` and the same one (but blurred), on the `Homescreen`.
